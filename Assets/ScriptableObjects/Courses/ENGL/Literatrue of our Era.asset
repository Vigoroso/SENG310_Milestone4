  description: Comparative study of literary works from the 20th and 21st centuries.
    Special attention to how writers have adapted styles and techniques to represent
    our own experiences and the challenges of our age. Lectures, discussions, and
    essay writing workshops combine to develop students' abilities to write and speak
    about literature, and to make academic arguments in any discipline.
