  description: 'Advanced techniques for design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms
    and data structures with an introduction to algorithm engineering. Algorithmic
    design paradigms: greedy, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, backtracking,
    branch and bound. Advanced Analysis techniques, such as amortization. Advanced
    data structures: hashing, disjoint sets. Advanced graph algorithms: network flow,
    connectivity, minimum spanning trees, shortest paths. Mathematical tools: graphs
    and digraphs, graph properties, planar graphs, networks; discrete probability,
    counting techniques, recurrences.'
